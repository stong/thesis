# Efficient Windows Application Fuzzing with Fork-Server

This repo contains my undergrad thesis, completed at Georgia Tech under the supervision of Prof. Taesoo Kim. Parts of this thesis were presented as part of NDSS'21, as the paper "[WINNIE: Fuzzing Windows Applications with Harness Synthesis and Fast Cloning](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/winnie-fuzzing-windows-applications-with-harness-synthesis-and-fast-cloning/)".
